# esp32-homekit-togglebuttons

Generates virtual switches for Apple HomeKit, each designed to switch between on and off states with every ON command. Accompanying each virtual switch is a virtual push button.

Activating the toggle switch (turning it on) initiates a single press on the corresponding virtual push button. Deactivating the toggle switch (turning it off) results in a double press on the virtual push button.
